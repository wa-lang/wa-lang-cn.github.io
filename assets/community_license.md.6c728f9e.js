<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">                       Version 3, 19 November 2007</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">                            Preamble</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">software for all its users.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">and/or modify the software.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">receive widespread use, become available for other developers to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">source code to the public.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">provide the source code of the modified version running there to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">code of the modified version.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">this license.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">modification follow.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  0. Definitions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">works, such as semiconductor masks.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">on the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">public, and in some countries other activities as well.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  1. Source Code.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">form of a work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">is widely used among developers working in that language.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">includes interface definition files associated with source files for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">subprograms and other parts of the work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Source.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">same work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  2. Basic Permissions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">makes it unnecessary.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">measures.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">technological measures.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    it, and giving a relevant date.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    released under this License and any conditions added under section</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    work need not make them do so.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">parts of the aggregate.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">in one of these ways:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    customarily used for software interchange.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    with subsection 6b.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    charge under subsection 6d.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">included in conveying the object code work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the only significant mode of use of the product.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">modification has been made.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">been installed in ROM).</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">protocols for communication across the network.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">source code form), and must require no special password or key for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">unpacking, reading or copying.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  7. Additional Terms.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">this License without regard to the additional permissions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    authors of the material; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    those licensors and authors.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">governed by this License along with a term that is a further</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">not survive such relicensing or conveying.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">where to find the applicable terms.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the above requirements apply either way.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  8. Termination.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">paragraph of section 11).</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">prior to 60 days after the cessation.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">your receipt of the notice.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">material under section 10.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  11. Patents.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">propagate the contents of its contributor version.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">patent against the party.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">country that you have reason to believe are valid.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">work and works based on it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">following paragraph.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">3 of the GNU General Public License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  14. Revised Versions of this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">address new problems or concerns.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">version or of any later version published by the Free Software</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">by the Free Software Foundation.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">to choose that version for the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  Later license versions may give you additional or different</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">later version.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  16. Limitation of Liability.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">SUCH DAMAGES.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">copy of the Program in return for a fee.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    (at your option) any later version.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">specific requirements.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#d8dee9ff;">if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.</span></span>
